## BBC Computing - How Does The Internet Work?

In an analogy of birds:
* **_Computers_** are like birds' nests.
* The **_Internet_** would connect the birds' nests together, so that the birds could talk to one another. Also could be called a **_network_**.
* The birds have to agree how to use the connections - how a message will be addressed, and how it will be passed on. On the Internet, these rules are **_protocols_**.
* If a message is too large, it will be broken into small pieces called **_packets_** to get it to its destination. Each packet includes instructions on how it fits together, where it came from, and where it is going.
* Each computer on the Internet has a unique numeric address called an **_IP Address_**. Each address can be looked up automatically using a **_Domain Name Server (DNS)_**, which is similar to a giant address book.
* When the address is found, the packets are guided along by **_routers_**, which pass them like batons in a relay race. When the delivery arrives, the instructions explain how to put all the packets back together.
