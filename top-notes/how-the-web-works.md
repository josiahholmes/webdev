In an analogy of birds:
* **_Computers_** are like birds' nests.
* The **_Internet_** would connect the birds' nests together, so that the birds could talk to one another. Also could be called a **_network_**.
* The birds have to agree how to use the connections - how a message will be addressed, and how it will be passed on. On the Internet, these rules are **_protocols_**.
* If a message is too large, it will be broken into small pieces called **_packets_** to get it to its destination. Each packet includes instructions on how it fits together, where it came from, and where it is going.
* Each computer on the Internet has a unique numeric address called an **_IP Address_**. Each address can be looked up automatically using a **_Domain Name Server (DNS)_**, which is similar to a giant address book.
* When the address is found, the packets are guided along by **_routers_**, which pass them like batons in a relay race. When the delivery arrives, the instructions explain how to put all the packets back together.

* **_Routers_** work to connect computers to one another, and to direct **_packets_** of information to their assigned destination.
    * Routers are able to connect to other routers, which can connect billions of computers around the world.
* An **_Internet Service Provider_** is a company that manages some special routers that link all together and can access other ISPs' routers.
* Any computer linked to a network has a unique address to identify it, known as the **_IP Address_**, where IP stands for _Internet Protocol_. The address is made up of a series of four numbers separated by dots (i.e., 8.8.8.8). 
* While computers are able to remember IP addresses, we prefer to use **_domain names_** that act as aliases for the addresses. (i.e., 173.194.121.32 = www.google.com).
* The **_Internet_** is an infrastructure, whereas the **_Web_** is a service built on top of the infrastructure.

* The computers we use are **_clients_**, because they connect to the Internet through ISPs.
