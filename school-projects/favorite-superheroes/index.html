            <h3>In recent years, Marvel has made quite a name for itself. In 2008, Marvel Studios released <i>Iron Man</i>, starting the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Aside from the thirteen movies that have been released, Marvel Television has explored new endeavors, including ABC's <i>Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>, and the Netflix hits <i>Daredevil</i>, <i>Jessica Jones</i>, and <i>Luke Cage</i>.</h3>
            <h3>On this website, there are four heroes from the comics universe that I consider favorites. You can select a character name from the drop-down list to see a brief history of the character and their powers/abilities. Descriptions of their powers have been paraphrased from <a href="http://marvel.wikia.com" target="_blank">Marvel's wikia page</a>, where more can be learned about the heroes.</h3>
